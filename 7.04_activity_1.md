# 7.04 Activity 1

The datasets are provided in the `files_for_activities` folder.

- For the example covered in the lab for the last lesson, using the test statistics and then using the p-value, do you reject the null hypothesis or you fail to reject the null hypothesis?

- Here is the question again for reference:
  It is assumed that the mean systolic blood pressure is `Î¼ = 120 mm Hg`. In the Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of n = 100 people had an average systolic blood pressure of `130.1 mm Hg` with a standard deviation of 21.21 mm Hg. Is the group significantly different (with respect to systolic blood pressure!) from the regular population?

  Set up the hypothesis test.
